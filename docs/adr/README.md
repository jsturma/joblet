# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Joblet project. ADRs document the key architectural
decisions made during development, including the context, the decision itself, and its consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and
consequences. ADRs help future developers understand not just *what* we built, but *why* we built it that way.

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Accepted|Deprecated|Superseded|Proposed]

## Context

[Describe the problem, why a decision needed to be made, what forces were at play, and what led to this decision point. Write this in a narrative style - tell the story of why this decision was necessary.]

## Decision

[Clearly state the decision that was made. What did we choose to do? Be specific and technical where necessary, but keep it readable.]

## Consequences

### The Good

[What positive outcomes resulted from this decision? What problems did it solve? What benefits did we gain?]

### The Trade-offs

[What did we give up? What became more complex? What limitations did we accept? Be honest about the downsides.]

### The Unexpected Benefits

[What positive outcomes emerged that we didn't anticipate? What serendipitous advantages did we discover?]

## Contributing

When adding a new ADR:

1. Use the next number in sequence (e.g., 008)
2. Follow the template above
3. Update this README with a link to your ADR
4. Write in a narrative, human style - tell the story
5. Be honest about trade-offs and mistakes
6. Include real examples where possible

## Why We Write ADRs

Writing ADRs serves several purposes:

1. **Future Understanding**: New team members can understand not just the code, but the reasoning behind it
2. **Decision History**: We can track how our architecture evolved over time
3. **Learning Tool**: Failed decisions are as valuable as successful ones for learning
4. **Confidence**: Well-documented decisions give confidence that choices were thoughtful, not arbitrary
