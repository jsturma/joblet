# This template file is used by certs_gen_embedded.sh
# to generate the actual rnx-config.yml with embedded certificates
# DO NOT ADD CERTIFICATES HERE - they will be embedded automatically

# Nodes section will be populated by the certificate generation script
# with the following structure:
#
# nodes:
#   default:

#     persistAddress: "SERVER_ADDRESS:50052"        # joblet-persist gRPC service (historical logs, metrics)
#     nodeId: "8f94c5b2-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678"  # Optional: Joblet node identifier for display
